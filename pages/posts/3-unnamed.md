## Intro

> This article reflects on my life from the week of `2025-04-21` to `2025-04-27`.

Continuing from the 5-am club last week. This week I managed to sleep at 9pm and wake up at 5am every day besides Saturday, the day before my Electro-Mechanical Energy Conversion and Transmission final, which I unfortunately had to pull an all-nighter for. The all-nighter was not necessary if I had used my time wisely, as it seems besides fixing my sleep schedule, the 5-am club has yet to help increase my productivity.

Nonetheless, I did pretty well in that Sunday final, which covered single phase/three phase transformers, DC/Induction motors, magnetic circuits and synchronous generators. Even without scaling I would end up with an A+. A stark contrast to my probability final...

Sunday exams are criminal as I have less than a day to clean up my dorm and move back home.

Super short post this week as I just finished exams and cleaning up and I just want to sleep.

Steve out.
