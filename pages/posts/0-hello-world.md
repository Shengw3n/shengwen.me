Wuxi, China
2025 World Fencing Championships

Canadian national team sabre fencer Steven Chen defeated all opponents, winning the final 15-0. Amidst the cheers, I opened my eyes to a white ceiling—the dream was over.

It's been over two years since I left fencing. In high school, I devoted most of my energy to the sport, alternating between training and preparing for IB exams during the pandemic when competitions were cancelled. Before starting university, I still harbored fantasies of continuing to fence daily and making the national team. Reality hit when university engineering coursework taught me humility, and fencing gradually faded from my focus.

Two days ago, my family doctor called saying my iron levels were high and I needed more exercise. That's when I realized that in three years of university, I had become an overweight cookie monster who doesn't exercise—even though in my subconscious, I still considered myself an athlete.

Looking back, most of the pain in my life has come from the mismatch between dreams and reality. If I had worked harder at fencing, perhaps I could have achieved good results before the pandemic. If my IB scores had been higher, perhaps I could have gone to a better university. If I had worked harder in my first two years of engineering, perhaps I would have passed the Tesla interview. While there's no need to dwell on the past, whenever I think of fencing, the pain never quite leaves.

## Why I'm Writing a Blog

I've wanted to write a blog for a long time—I've even changed blog engines multiple times, but could never stick with it. The first blog I encountered was [Huang Xuan's](https://huangxuan.me), a tech lead at Facebook React. Through his writing, I glimpsed the beauty of computer science, which inspired me to focus more on programming development despite my electrical engineering degree. Later, I discovered [YY Shuo's](https://www.zhihu.com/people/yyss2037) blog, a PhD in controls and robotics at CMU, which got me interested in control systems. I ultimately led our [school team](https://www.ubcrocket.com) to build a PID-controlled rocket that won second place in the Canadian rocketry competition. Recently, I read [pseudoyu's](https://www.pseudoyu.com) blog, and his weekly report format for recording and reflecting on life greatly inspired me.

Since starting university, time has flown by—assignments pile up like mountains, new faces constantly appear. Some months I accomplish so much it feels like a year has passed; other months I do almost nothing meaningful, just playing League of Legends all day. Despite being older and "smarter," I rarely reflect on what I've actually experienced, as if my life is on autopilot. Autopilot life feels too cyberpunk for me.

This is why I'm starting this blog—to record what I accomplish each month and what challenges I face. This will be a conversation with myself and an attempt to slow down and truly enjoy life.

## Starting My Internship

May marked the beginning of my first formal internship: embedded software at a [medical device startup](https://www.nztech.ca) founded by a UBC PhD. I'm mainly responsible for a product called [TIPSO Airpad](https://www.nztech.ca/airpad/), a device that allows doctors to operate computers sterily in operating rooms. Being a startup with few people and lots of work, even as an intern, your responsibilities are genuinely yours. Less than two weeks in, a client requested new features, so the pressure was immense. I worked overtime for two weeks before completing the functionality by month's end.

I had fantasized about learning machine learning and expanding my technical skills after work, but reality was that I was too tired to do anything but sleep when I got home.

Internship life has a completely different rhythm from university. In university, if you feel lazy and skip class, you just skip it—study in the library for a few hours, eat with friends, play some ping pong, and the day passes. Work is different: working life is fast-paced. What I found most difficult to adapt to was that everyone could focus on work for 8 hours straight. I was so used to working for three hours then resting for two that I'd never seen anything like this sustained focus.

However, after a month, I can clearly notice that my attention span has improved—I can code for 8 hours a day now (mainly due to deadline pressure). Reminder to constantly push yourself outside of your comfort zone.

## UBC Rocket

The good thing about working is that weekends are completely your own time, unlike university where weekends are spent cycling between reviewing and catching up on assignments. After starting work, my weekends became routine: Saturdays hanging out with friends, Sundays returning to UBC to work on the rocket.

This month I really enjoyed spending time with the rocket team, working from morning to night each session. Everyone's efficiency was high, and we completed our first hold-down test. We used the wrong mass for our simulation, which is why the PID values were all bad and the rocket went everywhere except straight. However, our firmware, hardware, and mechanical systems worked correctly, though our data storage system showed some hurdles. We'll fix our simulation in June and do another hold-down test. Our competition is in mid-August, and we'll need at least a couple of flight tests beyond the hold-down tests. The timeline is tight.

One thing that really boosted our productivity and overall vibe was the new recruits. I did some last-minute recruitment this time, personally reaching out to people with strong technical ability and responsibility. This was my first year doing recruitment for UBC Rocket, and I noticed the importance of referrals. There's only so much you can learn about a person through one interview—you can't guarantee they'll actually put in the work and stay motivated for the entire year. However, when you hire people you personally know who are known for being responsible and on top of things, your chance of a successful hire grows much higher.

As I move up the corporate ladder of university design teams, I find myself dedicating more time to project management, a skill I notice myself lacking. Finding sponsorships, managing budget and design decisions, and most importantly managing people. I find myself having difficulty addressing team members who are down in productivity, and sometimes I wonder if it's my fault for not giving them an easier task or offering more help. I notice my lack of strong leadership more after talking with [Marcus](https://www.marcusc.me), our avionics lead for another rocket at UBC Rocket. He's able to manage 10+ people for avionics design effectively, and every member seems motivated and dedicated. For the next competition cycle, I aim to be someone just like him.

## Friends

During university, I almost always hang out with the same sets of people, but this summer when I moved back home, I reconnected with old friends. I visited my high school with classmates—one interns at OpenAI, the other at Jane Street. When they talk computer science, I can't understand them. I also went hiking with my elementary school friend and narrowly escaped a bear attack on our way down the mountain trail. And I went to Stanley Park with my middle school friend who came back from UofT. Talking to all of them was a lot of fun.

## Books

One thing, among many, that I aim to improve is my time reading. I always considered myself an arts major at heart because I love reading. However, during my Stanley Park trip, my friend said she noticed I talk more like an engineering major now. That's when I realized I haven't properly read a book in ages—all I talk to my friends about is engineering and rockets.

So I quickly picked up a book to read. This month I'm starting with 小米创业思考, written by Lei Jun, Xiaomi's CEO, about the success of Xiaomi. I'll write my thoughts on it next month.

Unlike a monthly review, this feels more like a rant tbh, but hope you enjoyed reading this far.

Steven out :)
