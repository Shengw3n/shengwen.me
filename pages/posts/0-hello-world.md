## Welcome to my blog

![UBC Nest](/images/0.helloworld.jpeg)

Since university, time has flown a lot faster for me - assignments pile up, new faces pop up, and opportunities appear and disappear like fireflies on a hot summer night. Some weeks I accomplish so much it feels like a month passed. Other weeks I barely do anything productive at all and just mindlessly play League of Legends all day.

Despite being older and "wiser", I find myself reflecting less on what I'm actually experiencing, as if my life was on autopilot. Autopilot cars sounds cool and all, but autopilot life is too cyberpunk for me.

That's why I'm starting this blog - to record what I accomplished in a week, and what challenges I faced. It would be a conversation with myself and an attempt to slow down and really enjoy my life.

## About the site

This site is a [Vue-Vite](https://vite.dev) project I forked from [this repository](https://github.com/antfu/antfu.me) and altered to match my style. And yes, I built it during finals as a way to ~~procrastinate~~ productively procrastinate. Classic Steven move.

Please feel free to look around :)

Steve out.
