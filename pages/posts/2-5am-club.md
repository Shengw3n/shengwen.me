## Intro

> This article reflects on my life from the week of `2025-04-14` to `2025-04-20`.

This week was neither productive nor positive. After delivering what was quite possibly my worst final exam performance ever in Probability, I've had a revelation: it's time to radically change my study habits. Perhaps instead of cramming the day before finals, I could try studying from day one! Revolutionary thinking.

But maybe the issue runs deeper. Maybe I need to fix my lifestyle first - after all, healthy body, healthy mind. I've started reading "The 5 AM Club" by Robin Sharma and committed myself to this sleeping-at-9PM-waking-at-5AM schedule. So far, the results are interesting. While I do get sleepy around noon, I felt great overall. Perhaps I still need to give my body sometime to adjust.

Once I've conquered my sleep schedule, the master plan includes eating healthier, drinking more water, tracking my hours of productivity, and be the best Steven possible. Basically, getting actual control over my life. Come to think of it, that's really what this blog is about too - taking weekly snapshots to understand where all my time actually goes.

## Ping Pong Adventures

My friends have been persistently nudging me to try ping pong, and I finally caved. Here's a quick table tennis session after exams:

Not the most eventful week, I'll admit. I'm writing this while prepping for my Electro-Mechanical Energy Conversion and Transmission final, still processing my probability disaster.

Steve out.
