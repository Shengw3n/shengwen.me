## Intro

> This article reflects on my life from the week of `2025-04-14` to `2025-04-20`.

This week was neither productive nor positive. After delivering what was quite possibly my worst final exam performance ever in Probability, I've had a revelation: it's time to radically change my study habits. Perhaps instead of cramming the day before finals, I could try studying from day one! Revolutionary thinking.

## The 5 am Club

But maybe the issue runs deeper. Maybe I need to fix my lifestyle first - after all, healthy body, healthy mind. I've started reading "The 5 AM Club" by Robin Sharma and committed myself to this sleeping-at-9PM-waking-at-5AM schedule. So far, the results are interesting. While I do get sleepy around noon, I felt great overall. Perhaps I still need to give my body sometime to adjust.

Once I've conquered my sleep schedule, the master plan includes eating healthier, drinking more water, tracking my hours of productivity, and be the best Steven possible. Basically, getting actual control over my life. Come to think of it, that's really what this blog is about too - taking weekly snapshots to understand where all my time actually goes.

## Marking Finals for APSC 160

This term was also my second term being a teaching assistant at UBC's APSC 160 course, an introductory computer science course for engineering students. I was put on a lot of tasks this term, from lecture teaching, lab hosting to leading exam invigilations and ultimately making the midterm/final questions. It's definitely an interesting experience designing questions and Python scripts for auto-marking, and seeing the results of the students. I finished marking finals this week for them and it definitely feels good to know most had fun with my questions.

## Ping Pong Adventures

My friends have been persistently nudging me to try ping pong, and I finally caved. Here's a quick table tennis session after exams:

Not the most eventful week, I'll admit. I'm writing this while prepping for my Electro-Mechanical Energy Conversion and Transmission final, still processing my probability disaster.

Steve out.
